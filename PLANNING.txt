PLANNING

time_stamps object:

key will be either a:
    string (the "description") -> a stamp not in any reported function.
    tuple (*fnames, "description" | (0, -1))
        -> *fnames is one or more filenames in nested order
        -> the last value is either the description, or 0 or -1. When it is 0 or -1 then it is the start or end of a function respectively.

TODO: add numpy support to optimise storage of the timestamp data?
TODO: make each function frame be its own object. This can then have special methods defined on it to extract all the info more easily
